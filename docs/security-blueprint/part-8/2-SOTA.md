# Software Over The Air

Software updates in connected vehicles are a very useful feature, which can
deliver significant benefits. If not implemented with security in mind,
software updates can incur serious vulnerabilities. Any software update system
must ensure that not only are the software updates to devices done in a secure way,
but also that the repositories and servers hosting these updates are adequately
protected. As the process of updating software migrates from a Dealership update model
towards an **OTA** update model, securing these processes becomes a high priority.

**SOTA** is made possible by **AppFw** (See Platform part). It will be possible
to manage in a simple way the packets (i.g. Android like).
