    <h1 id="contributor-guidelines">Contributor Guidelines</h1>

<p>Thanks for helping to improve AGL ! This page provides a general guide on making contributions to AGL. If you can’t find something on this page, please feel free to contact the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/automotive-discussions">mailing list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Before contributing to AGL, please complete the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an account on <a href="https://identity.linuxfoundation.org/">identity.linuxfoundation.org</a> to get started.</li>
  <li>Join the <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/automotive-discussions">mailing list</a>.</li>
  <li>Setup your Gerrit account, as described in <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial">the Gerrit Tutorial from mediawiki</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="working-with-jira">Working with JIRA</h2>

<p>Issues for AGL are hosted in the <a href="https://jira.automotivelinux.org/">AGL JIRA server</a>. When reporting issues, please follow <a href="./issues.html">these guidelines</a>.</p>

<h3 id="claiming-issues">Claiming Issues</h3>
<p>If you find a JIRA issue that you would like to work on, you can ask to claim it; please leave a comment indicating your intention and a committer will assign it to you. Some issues in JIRA are auto-assigned to certain contributors. If it is clear that an issue is not being worked on, feel free to work on it yourself (but please comment first to let the asignee know).</p>

<h2 id="submitting-code">Submitting Code</h2>

<h3 id="access-control">Access Control</h3>

<p>Access control to gerrit is defined in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lA_B7LEwn_VyJy_JplRNe9AOKTRGAMtpJ66JHm-vJCM/pubhtml?gid#0&amp;single#true">google doc spreadsheet</a></p>

<h5 id="gerrit-roles">Gerrit Roles</h5>

<p>The overall Gerrit workflow for a code change submitted to the project follows this diagram.</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/agl_gerrit_dataflow.png" alt="Gerrit roles" title="Gerrit roles" /></p>

<p>One can assume that requesting changes to be reverted will follow the same flow as those for new code and patches. Access to various functions within gerrit is granted according the roles defined here.</p>

<h4 id="agl-committer">AGL Committer</h4>
<p>The most general role in the project is the AGL-committer. They may push proposed changes to gerrit, initiate a code review of those changes, and perform code reviews of proposed changes.</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/agl_committer_access_gerrit.png" alt="AGL Committer" title="Committer access" /></p>

<h4 id="agl-mergers">AGL Mergers</h4>

<p>The ability to accept and merge changes into the AGL Repositories is reserved for role of AGL-mergers. AGL-mergers have all access granted to AGL-committers as well as the ability to +2 or -2 any proposed changes and submit those changes to the AGL Repository in gerrit. Self-review  by AGL Mergers is generally frowned upon and AGL-mergers should only give a +2 or -2 after others reviewers after weighed in on the change.</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/agl_mergers_access.png" alt="AGL Mergers" title="Mergers access" /></p>

<h4 id="general-access">General Access</h4>

<p>Registered users in gerrit without any of the above access levels may fetch the repositories or may participate in reviews. This allows registered users to be added to reviews by committers without having to be added to the Committer list.</p>

<p><img src="../static/img/agl_general_gerrit_access_v2.png" alt="Gerrit Access" title="Gerrit Access" /></p>

<hr />

<h4 id="patch-review-and-merge-policy">Patch Review and Merge Policy</h4>

<p>In addition to providing comments and suggestions for improvement, reviewers are encouraged to respond to changes with an overall +1, -1 type value. The meaning of these numbers is explained in the <a href="Gerrit documentation">https://gerrit.baserock.org/Documentation/config-labels.html#label_Code-Review</a></p>

<p>Here is a brief summary of the values:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>-2: This must not be merged.
-1: I would prefer that this is not merged as is.
0: I am not making any statement about this change at the moment.
+1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve it.
+2: Looks good to me, approved.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>These values do not get added together by Gerrit, so two +1s do not lead to an automatic merge.</p>

<p>Changes can only be merged to the master branch once they have received a +2 and no -2. Only members of the  AGL-Mergers group can give +2.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="gerrit-use-cases">Gerrit Use Cases</h3>

<h4 id="actors">Actors</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App Developer (AD)</strong> - Someone who is developing applications to be used with AGL. The AD is assumed to need no knowledge of Yocto and relies on an SDK.</li>
  <li><strong>Registered Developer (RD)</strong> - Someone who wants to contribute code to AGL but may not be affiliated with a subsystem</li>
  <li><strong>Subsystem Maintainer (SM)</strong> - A SM is the same as Subsystem Developer but with additional privileges that allow him to submit changes to the master branch, tracking branch, or a maintenance branch</li>
  <li><strong>System Integrator (SI)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Release Manager (RM)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Unregistered Developer (UD)</strong> - A developer who downloads and uses AGL code but does not plan to contribute code.</li>
  <li><strong>CI System Manager (CISM)</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="repositories">Repositories</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Meta-data repositories define Yocto layers and contain build recipes and patches. They do not contain source code other than patches</li>
  <li>Source Code repositories contain source code. Build recipes for the code will being the meta-data repositories Examples include:
    <ul>
      <li>AGL is the upstream for the particular component</li>
      <li>AGL is using code back-ported from later versions of a new component or part of a component (e.g., MOST USB driver in mainline kernel tree)</li>
      <li>AGL is maintaining code out of the upstream tree which may or may not be accepted upstream (this should be rare since it implies a fork of the upstream code. Patches are preferable)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="prepare-to-push-changes-in-gerrit">Prepare to push changes in Gerrit</h4>
<p>By default the repo tool will have clone git repo with http for fetch and ssh to push.
   #cd meta-agl
   #git remote -v
       agl	https://gerrit.automotivelinux.org/gerrit/AGL/meta-agl (fetch)
       agl	ssh://gerrit.automotivelinux.org:29418/AGL/meta-agl (push)</p>

<p>if you want to use your ssh config, add your gerrit user accout to your ssh config file like:
   #cat ~/.ssh/config
     Host gerrit.automotivelinux.org
     User XXXMyNameXXX</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Then you still need to enter you ssh public key in Gerrit. You can find a HowTo [[ https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/Tutorial#Set_Up_SSH_Keys_in_Gerrit</td>
      <td>here ]]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="push-changes-for-review-to-gerrit">Push changes for review to Gerrit</h4>

<h5 id="git-commit-messages">Git Commit Messages</h5>

<p>You are highly encouraged to describe your git commit with enough detail for someone else to understand it. In doing so, your commit message can consist of multiple lines. However, it also is highly encouraged that the first line of your commit message not exceed 50 characters. This is because some of the tooling that sits on top of git (such as the httpd apps that let you browse the repos) assumes that the first line is top-level summary that is 50 characters or less. Thus there will be highlighting and truncating of the commit message using these assumptions and it will look weird if these assumptions are not kept. There should also be a blank line between the summary and any further description.</p>

<p>If the commit is related to a JIRA issue, you can specify ‘Bug-AGL: ‘ followed by the issue number.</p>

<p>For example, here is a good commit message:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Fixed the whizbang widget

Bug-AGL: SPEC-0000

- added more sanity checking in the build script.
- fixed the API to return the correct value in the scenario where there
  aren't any whizbangs present.
- corrected the documentation.
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As an alternate to a bullet list, you could put long text here in paragraph form, with each line wrapped at 72 chars and blank lines between paragraphs.</p>

<p>Please sign you commit before you submit the change (otherwise it will not be accepted by gerrit):
   git commit –signoff</p>

<ul>
  <li>Then either use plain git to push:</li>
</ul>

<p>git push agl HEAD:refs/for/master
   git push <remote> HEAD:refs/for/<targetbranch></targetbranch></remote></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Or</strong> for more convenience, install “git-review” and instead of git push use:</li>
</ul>

<p># first time only
   git review -s</p>

<p># then to push use
   git review</p>
